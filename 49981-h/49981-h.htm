<br /><span class="small">(<i>Calypte anna.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Buffon, writing of the Hummingbird,
and his words do not refer to any
single species, but to them as a group,
says that &ldquo;the emerald, the ruby and the
topaz glitter in its garb, which is never
soiled with the dust of earth, for, leading
an aerial life, it rarely touches the
turf, even for an instant. Always in the
air, flying from flower to flower, it shares
their freshness and their splendor, lives
on their nectar, and only inhabits those
climates in which they are unceasingly
renewed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the birds that might receive the
appellation, &ldquo;The Bird of America,&rdquo; to
none could it be applied more truthfully
than to the Hummingbird. For of all
the families of birds that are distinctively
peculiar to the Americas the Trochilid&aelig;,
or the Hummingbird family, contains
the larger number of species. There are
over five hundred species inhabiting
North and South America and the adjacent
islands, from Patagonia on the
South to Alaska on the North. The species
is more numerous in the tropics and
but seventeen are known to frequent the
United States. Of these only one, the
ruby-throated hummingbird, exhibits
its beauty east of the Mississippi River,
and but seven species have their breeding
range chiefly or entirely within the
United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They abound most in mountainous
countries, where the configuration of the
surface and productions of the soil are
most diversified within small areas. Their
center of abundance is among the Northern
Andes, between the parallels of ten
degrees north and south of the equator,
from which region they gradually diminish
in numbers both to the northward
and southward, but much more rapidly
toward the extensive lowlands of the
eastern portion of the continent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very interesting group, not so gem-like
as many of their sister species, is the
hermit hummers represented by a number
of species that chiefly inhabit Brazil.
These hummingbirds are notable for
their plain colors, their plumage having
but little of the lustrous metallic iridescence
which is so marked a characteristic
of the species with which we are more
familiar and which frequent flowers in
the bright sunshine. The laws of Nature
seem to provide against excess even in
coloration. The hermit hummers obtain
their food only from the insect world,
feeding upon those species found on
the leaves of trees in deep forests. In
such a home a gorgeous dress would be
out of place and needless.</p>
<p>Regarding their actions, Mr. Robert
Ridgway says: &ldquo;Hummingbirds are so
distinct from other birds in their external
structures and manner of flight that
they present in every respect, except
when at rest, an appearance entirely peculiar
to themselves. They spend perhaps
the greater part of their time upon the
wing, usually hovering or balancing
themselves before a flower from which
they are procuring their sustenance of
honey or of minute insects. At such time
the body is nearly vertical or inclined at
a slight angle, the head bent nearly at
right angles with the axis of the body,
the wings spread nearly at right angles
with the same axis.&rdquo; The motion of the
wings, which is always rapid, may carry
the bird in a horizontal direction or poise
it in its vertical attitude directly over a
flower. In this latter position the motion
of the wings is so rapid that a mere haze
appears on each side of the bird&rsquo;s body.
Mr. Gould, speaking of their flight, says
&ldquo;The bird does not usually glide through
the air with the quick, darting flight of a
swallow or swift, but continues tremulously
moving its wings while passing
from flower to flower, or when taking a
more distant flight over a high tree or
across a river.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Such a dainty dress as that worn by
most of the hummingbirds deserves
constant attention. Appreciating this
these little lovers of sunshine are very
fond of preening their beautiful feathers.
While thus engaged they usually perch
on a bare or dead twig in an exposed position.
Truly fortunate is he who is afforded
the opportunity of watching a
hummingbird at this time. In this position
various and graceful attitudes are
assumed and the colors of the plumage
are most beautifully exhibited. Mr. Audubon
tells us that when perching the
hummingbirds &ldquo;move sidewise in prettily
measured steps, frequently opening
and closing their wings, pluming, stroking
and arranging the whole of their apparel
with neatness and activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hummingbirds are very aggressive
and show no fear, especially when defending
their nests. They will furiously
attack any bird or other animal that excites
their enmity. They have been known
to follow and annoy hawks and other
birds much larger than themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Ridgway says: &ldquo;In their disposition
hummingbirds are not only very
tame but highly curious or inquisitive,
and exhibit a special propensity to closely
inspect a human intruder to their domain.&rdquo;
This characteristic may be frequently
noticed in the actions of our
common ruby-throat. In spite of the fact
that the hummingbirds are easily tamed
and may even be induced to take food
from the hand or from a flower so held as
to attract their attention, they do not
survive confinement for any length of
time.</p>
<p>Although the nectar of flowers forms a
large part of their food, it has been shown
that insects also form no inconsiderable
portion.</p>
<p>The high degree of intelligence possessed
by the hummingbirds is shown
in the construction of their nests. Some
of the species make the nests &ldquo;of such
form or material as will serve to imitate
natural excrescences of a branch, such as
a knot or a pine cone.&rdquo; Other species
make a hammock-like nest that they suspend
from cliffs by attaching spiders&rsquo;
webs. Mr. Thomas M. Brewer writes:
&ldquo;Indeed, it is probable that there is no
other family whose architectural achievements
are more varied than those of the
hummingbirds. These variations include
not only the material of which the
nests are made and the positions in which
they are placed; but also the general style
of their construction, exhibiting constant
differences, in the several species, in the
ingenuity and beauty displayed in each
design.&rdquo; Even individual species will
change the usual plan of their nests in
order to adapt them to the requirements
of their environment. In favorable localities
a new nest will be built each season
on top of the old one of the year before.
&ldquo;The hermit hummingbirds fasten their
elongated nests to one side of the extremity
of long-pointed leaves for protection,
it is supposed, against monkeys and
other predaceous animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eggs of the hummingbirds, invariably
two in number, are white and
free from spots. Though very small
they are large when compared with the
size of the bird that laid them. It is
claimed by most authorities that under
favorable conditions two broods are
raised each season.</p>
<p>The Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbird of our illustration
is one of the most striking of
those best known. It is perhaps the
most beautiful of the species that frequent
the United States. It is a native
of California and in its migrations passes
southward through Arizona to the table-lands
of Mexico. It is also found in
Lower California.</p>
<p>The head and ruff of the male have
a lustrous metallic purplish red color.
The female is bronze green above,
though the top of the head is sometimes
brownish, showing but little if any metallic
luster. Both sexes vary somewhat
in color. This is especially true of the
males, some individuals having more
purplish red on the crown and throat
than others.</p>
<p>This species inhabits a metal producing
region and it is an interesting fact, as
cited by Mr. Gould in his &ldquo;Monograph of
the Hummingbirds,&rdquo; that &ldquo;those districts
or countries having a metalliferous
character are tenanted by species of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
hummingbirds which are more than
ordinarily brilliant and glittering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Charles Bendire in his &ldquo;Life
Histories of North American Birds,&rdquo;
records an interesting observation of Mr.
A. W. Anthony regarding the hatching
of an Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbird. These
words probably well describe the process
followed by all the species.</p>
<p>Writing in regard to a set of eggs
which he had collected, he says: &ldquo;I was
somewhat disgusted to find one of the
eggs pipped and, realizing the difficulty
of making a presentable specimen of it,
was on the point of throwing it away
when a movement on the part of the
tiny creature within the shell suggested
to my mind that I hatch the egg and find
out for myself how baby hummingbirds
come into the world. So far there was
but a pin point broken, the rest of the
shell being intact; and it was several
minutes before the warmth of my hand,
aided by my breath, produced another
movement upon the part of the prospective
hummer; first a feeble struggle, followed
by an interval of rest; another
squirm and the point of the bill came in
view and was withdrawn; after a moment&rsquo;s
rest a new system was adopted,
which consisted of turning around in the
shell from right to left and cutting a
clean, smooth opening with the sharp,
horny tip on the upper mandible; this
operation was evidently hard work and
required all the strength of the little
mite, and frequent rests were necessary to
recruit. Sometimes an interval of twisting
seemed to accomplish nothing, and
it would look as if all its struggles would
be in vain. I wondered whether the
parent would not render a little much-needed
assistance at this stage; but after
an interval of rest the work would be
continued with renewed vigor and another
millimetre cut toward the outer
world. The cutting was all done in the
same direction. When the shell had been
cut four-fifths around, the chick succeeded
in getting one claw hooked over the
edge of the break, and by one or two
vigorous pushes broke the remaining
shell, leaving in my hand two nearly
equal parts of what had been a hummingbird&rsquo;s
egg and a squirming something
that bore no semblance whatever
to one of the peerless members of the
genus Calypte.&rdquo; The entire operation,
which added another individual to America&rsquo;s
beautiful family of birds, required
but fifteen minutes of time. The energy
and perseverance of the little mass of
flesh was a hint of that pugnacious disposition
that would be so striking a characteristic
when it became fully grown
and clothed with its resplendent metallic
plumage.</p>

<h2 id="c4">EXPERIENCES WITH &ldquo;HUMMERS.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Did you ever hold a live hummingbird
in your hand? Well, I have held several
of the wee, wee creatures. Did you ever
look into a hummingbird&rsquo;s nest? Well,
I have peeped into several of the tiny,
downy affairs.</p>
<p>Two of the nests contained eggs; one
contained young birds. The eggs were
as small as an ordinary garden pea&mdash;perfectly
egg-shaped. Can I describe the
young of the hummingbird? No, impossible.
I can only say that they are the
smallest animal I ever saw in all my
life. Of course, that does not include
the insect world.</p>
<p>How did I contrive to get hold of a
live hummingbird? Easy enough when
you know how.</p>
<p>One hot afternoon in June I was sitting
in a garden reading. A few yards
away stood a large bunch of brilliant carnations.
Now, if there is anything which
a hummer fairly dotes on it is pinks.
Suddenly I heard a loud hum near by.
I looked toward the carnations, and, sure
enough, there were too hummingbirds
hovering around the flowers.</p>
<p>I watched their movements for several
moments with great interest. Presently
I observed that one of the birds appeared
to be entangled. Its tongue, or long,
needle-like beak, was caught in some
manner in the petals of a large pink. The
little fellow kept fluttering around in a
helpless way, but could not liberate itself.</p>
<p>Instantly I dropped the book and ran
over to the bed. The other hummingbird
darted away like a shot. I very softly
took the tiny prisoner in my hand and
then gently liberated it. For half a minute
or more I held the trembling, fluttering
creature in my hand. I wish I could
describe the beauty and brilliancy of its
plumage. Silk, velvet and the delicate
tints of the rainbow are the only adequate
words. Finally I released the prisoner.
In a flash he was out of sight.</p>
<p>One good fright was enough. Neither
bird ever came back to the carnations
again. At least, the pinks were not visited
by any more hummingbirds that season.</p>
<p>Last summer I was out with a fishing
party. We went far back into the
mountains, where it was rugged, wild
and lonely. One day I was out fishing
along a rushing torrent. There was a
deep, swirling eddy where I was angling,
and just on the bank stood a small cedar
tree. A long, slender limb hung only a
few feet above my head.</p>
<p>While I was fishing a hummingbird
came buzzing around my head. It kept
circling around me for some time. Finally
I stopped fishing. Instantly the
bird alighted on a twig and eyed me closely
with its bright bead-like eye. A moment
later the little mate arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely there must be a nest near by,&rdquo;
I said to myself. Then I began fishing.</p>
<p>Both birds immediately came whirring
about my ears like two hornets. They
kept it up until I desisted. Then both
alighted and watched me sharply. Again
and again I tried to fish, but the little
creatures would give me no peace.</p>
<p>Down I laid my rod and began to look
carefully for a nest. Sure enough, there
was one concealed amidst the cedar
boughs. It was right above my head
where I stood fishing. Very gently I
pulled the pendent branch down until I
could peep into the thimble of a nest,
which contained beautiful eggs. Meantime
the birds kept buzzing around my
head in a most distracted manner.</p>
<p>Having satisfied my curiosity I quietly
withdrew, to the evident delight of the
little parents.</p>
<p>On another occasion I was out in an
orchard. I noticed two hummingbirds
flying around a certain apple tree limb.
As I approached the birds became more
excited. When within a few yards of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
tree I noticed a young bird sitting on a
nest. He was almost grown. Not wishing
to frighten the little chap, I stopped
abruptly. But he darted away. However,
his wings were too weak, and down
he sank fluttering, falling into a big tuft
of tall grass.</p>
<p>He was perfectly helpless, so I very
tenderly picked him up and placed him
back on the nest. To my surprise and
amusement he did not attempt to escape,
but stood up boldly and looked at me in
a saucy, defiant way. The parent birds
were buzzing around me like angry bees,
but when they saw that I did not harm
their offspring they both alighted near
the nest.</p>
<p>A large clump of wild currants stood
in one corner of the yard. I noticed two
hummingbirds almost constantly hovering
around the bush among the large yellow
flowers.</p>
<p>I went out one afternoon and secreted
myself in the clump, in order to observe
more closely the actions and peculiarities
of the birds. One was the largest hummingbird
I had ever seen, and its plumage
was simply gorgeous.</p>
<p>Soon the birds came around, but they
did not seem in the least alarmed by my
presence. The larger one came very near,
and actually flew against my face. I held
up my hand, when the bird flew straight
into it. I instantly closed my fingers and
held him a prisoner. His plumage was
brilliant beyond description. As the beautiful
captive did not seem to resent my
familiarity, I examined his coat carefully
before giving the bird its freedom.</p>
<p>I had still another experience with a
hummer. On a bright summer day one
flew through an open door into a room
where I was sitting. Quick as a flash the
bird discovered its mistake. It dashed
against a window pane with all its might
and dropped on the floor. I hastily picked
it up. It seemed quite dead. But as I
held it in my open hand, silently sympathizing
over its fate, the bird suddenly
revived and flitted out through the open
door before I could wink.</p>

<br />Life-size.
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c6">THE RUFOUS HUMMINGBIRD.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Selasphorus rufus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>This hardy little &ldquo;Hummer,&rdquo; which is
even smaller than our well-known ruby-throated
hummingbird, is weighted
with a number of popular names. Among
these are the &ldquo;Rufous-backed Hummingbird,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Ruff-necked Honeysucker,
or Hummingbird,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Rufous Flame-bearer&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Cinnamon Hummer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rufous is probably the most widely
distributed of all the hummingbirds.
Its range extends throughout Western
North America. It breeds from the
higher mountains of Southern California
northward, near the coast to Nootka
Sound, Alaska. In its migrations it
flies eastward to Montana, Colorado and
thence southward through New Mexico
to Western Texas. In fact, during this
period it frequents the eastern slopes
of the Rocky Mountains, adding beauty
to this wild region. Its winter home is
chiefly in Mexico and Lower California.</p>
<p>This Hummingbird is exceedingly
pugnacious and, as Mr. Henshaw says,
&ldquo;The fiery red throat of the Rufous-backed
Hummer is an index of impetuous,
aggressive disposition, and when
brought into conflict with the other species
it invariably asserts its supremacy
and drives its rival in utter rout from the
field. Nor do the males of this species
confine their warfare to their own sex.
Gallantry has no place apparently in their
breasts, and when conquest has put
them in possession of a perch near a
clump of flowers they wage war on all
comers, females as well as males.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rufous Hummer is one of the earliest
of the migratory birds to leave its
winter home, and arrives within the borders
of the United States early in March
and is known to begin housekeeping as
far North as the State of Oregon early
in April. Altitude as well as climate
seems to have much influence in the selection
of a nesting sight. The altitude
of the breeding range seems to lie between
four and seven thousand feet above
the sea level, and nests have been reported
as high as ten thousand feet.</p>
<p>Mr. A. W. Anthony, writing of this
species as he observed it in Oregon, says
that &ldquo;they nested to some extent in oaks,
blackberry vines and on dry roots projecting
from upturned trees. One nest
hung from the end of a tall fern, while
others, drooping over it from above, hid
the beautiful structure from all but accidental
discovery. Their favorite sites,
however, seemed to be the long, trailing
vines overhanging embankments and upturned
trees. A number were found in
railroad cuts. One nest was found that
had been placed on top of a last year&rsquo;s
habitation, a mere rim being built to raise
the sides, and a flooring being added to
cover up a large pebble that could be
plainly felt under the cotton lining.&rdquo; This
habit of adding stories to nests of the
previous season is not infrequent with
other species of the hummingbirds.</p>
<p>The nest of the Rufous Hummingbird
resembles those of many other species
of hummers, and it is very much
like that of the Anna&rsquo;s hummingbird.
The framework is composed of delicate
tree mosses and fine bark fiber, the outer
face of which is sometimes adorned with
lichens, though not so profusely as is
that of the Anna&rsquo;s, and fastened together
with spider&rsquo;s webs and the silky threads
from cocoons. It is lined with the fine
cotton down of plants, especially that of
the willow, and the pappus of the Compositae.
These nests seem large when
compared with the size of the bird. The
average nest measures about one and
one-half inches in the outer diameter and
one and one-fourth inches in depth.
&ldquo;Their nesting sites may be looked for
in low bushes as well as on the horizontal
limbs of trees at various distances
from the ground.&rdquo; When compared
with other species of the family this species
is quite noisy, especially when it sees
a broad-tailed hummer in the neighborhood.
For this species it exhibits an intense
animosity and will pursue it, uttering
shrill and expressively angry
notes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c7">WHAT A LITTLE MOUSE SAID.</h2>
<p>I am only a little mouse; my name is
Wee Wee.</p>
<p>I live in a big house away out in California.
My mother has made a very cozy
home for us between the walls where it
is nice and dark. We do not mind the
dark, you know, for we can see even better
then, with our little bright eyes.</p>
<p>Our bed is soft and warm and is made
of tiny bits of paper which we children
helped our mother to tear up and it is
lined with some nice soft cotton which
she picked out of a comforter one night
when every-one had gone to church.</p>
<p>We have never been out very much but
now, our mother says, we are big enough
to help get the living. When she told us
this, we all said: &ldquo;Squeak, squeak,
squeak,&rdquo; which, in mouse language,
meant that we were glad and thought it
would be fine fun to leave our nest and
go out into the big world.</p>
<p>But mother said: &ldquo;Children, before you
go I want to tell you something; listen
well to what I shall say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we six little mice sat very solemnly
in a row, on our hind legs and
pricked up our ears and listened quietly
while she went on. &ldquo;You go through a
narrow passage till you come to a little
round hole and when you have squeezed
through this you will find yourself in a
big room called a kitchen. You must
then run quickly across the floor and into
the door of a bathroom. There is also a
hole behind the bathroom door which
you may need to jump into if anything
happens. Next comes a nice, large pantry
and in there you will find everything
that we mice like to eat. Bring what you
can carry, after you have eaten all you
can, but do not eat too much or you will
never be able to squeeze through the hole
again. Now you must never go in the
daytime, but wait until night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After telling us this, my mother left
the nest saying that she was going to call
on one of our neighbors who lived in an
old felt hat, very near us. She said she
might be gone some time, so, while my
brothers and sisters were taking a nap,
I thought to myself: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
mother told me not to go in daylight. I
am sure everything seems perfectly quiet
now and I don&rsquo;t think anything could
hurt me; and I do feel so hungry. I
guess I will go on a little trip, and &lsquo;we
shall see what we shall see.&rsquo;&rdquo; With that
I crept out of the nest without making
the least bit of noise and followed the directions
my mother had given me.</p>
<p>Soon I found myself in the pantry and
O! how good everything did smell. I
found some cheese and I ate a very big
hole in a white cake with icing on it and
was just thinking what I could carry
home as a surprise for the children when
I heard a rushing noise like the patter of
feet and I jumped behind some glass jars
that were on the floor in the corner.</p>
<p>To my horror I saw very near me, for
I could see right through the glass jar, a
funny thing with long white wool and
sharp teeth, a long, pointed nose and a
terrible big red tongue hanging out of its
mouth and little sharp black eyes that
seemed to be looking clear through me.
Oh! how I trembled and oh! how I
wished then that I had obeyed my
mother.</p>
<p>I saw now, when it was too late, that
she knew best. Just then a big giant with
dresses on came into the pantry and I
heard her say: &ldquo;That dog thinks there is
a mouse in here.&rdquo; So it was a dog and I
remembered now that my mother had
said one day that there was a spitz dog in
that house.</p>
<p>The lady went out but the dog smelled
me and was determined not to give me
up so he ran to the big giant with dresses
on and whined and whined until she came
in again and said: &ldquo;Well, Zip, I guess
there must be a mouse here since you insist
on it.&rdquo; So she went out and got a
long stick with a lot of straws on the end
of it (she called it a broom), and with
that she poked around all over the pantry,
and the funny thing with long, white wool
and sharp teeth kept smelling around and
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
clawing at the glass jars till I thought I
should die of fright. &ldquo;It must be behind
those jars, the way Zip acts,&rdquo; she said;
and she took the broom and knocked over
all the jars with a crash. Well! I thought
my time had surely come. My eyes filled
with tears and my heart almost broke
as I thought of my dear mother and all
my sisters and brothers so happy at
home.</p>
<p>But just in that terrible moment I happened
to remember what my mother had
said about running into that other hole
in case anything should happen, so with
one bound I was on the floor and the
funny thing with long, white wool and
sharp teeth made a grab for me. I could
feel his hot breath close upon me and I
could almost feel his sharp teeth when I
heard the big giant with dresses on say:
&ldquo;Catch him, Zip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But surely a kind fate must have been
with me for I was too quick for them.
I never ran so fast in my life. I fairly
flew till I found the hole behind the door
and jumped in and ran along till I found
myself once more at home, where all the
family were frightened almost to death at
my absence.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience I shall always
do what my mother tells me to, for
after all, she knows best.</p>

<h2 id="c8">ABOUT A SPARROW.</h2>
<p>There have been tales told about this
curious little rowdy among birds. He
was a nuisance; he drove our song and
grub-eating birds away; he also littered
the cornices of buildings and made of
himself a pest in general. There have
been other tales told about the cute chap
who perches upon a wire near the window
and rocks his clever head toward
you when you tap against the pane; and
still another story is told concerning the
lynching of one by a flock of the brisk
chaps. Some say they took a bit of twine,
fastened it to a wire, secured the victim,
and induced him to put his head through
a loop; then drew the twine and scattered,
leaving a lot of wise men to gaze
upon the wonderful spectacle, which the
newspapers took up and printed. I have
watched birds for years and I never saw
an incident of the sort&mdash;the lynching of a
sparrow by his fellow sparrows! A sparrow
has been caught in the loop of a bit
of twine fastened to a wire or a cornice;
but no sparrow ever deliberately put the
twine up and lynched one of his rowdy
brood. He wouldn&rsquo;t do it simply because
he hasn&rsquo;t got bird instinct enough to follow
out such a tragedy. I will tell you
a little incident concerning a sparrow
which I know to be true. It didn&rsquo;t find
a place in any newspaper, either, simply
because I never gave it much thought until
now, hence never mentioned it before.</p>
<p>I had noticed upon arising for several
mornings in the early spring a half dozen
or so of sparrows congregated in a sunny
spot of the roof below. At first I paid
no attention to it, for the sparrow is apt
to go where he pleases, man&rsquo;s wishes to
the contrary notwithstanding. But the
little chaps were there every morning,
and in the same sunny spot. I was curious
to know why they came there, and I
went down stairs one morning to watch
them from a more close point of observation.
I got there before they came. I
stood back of a closed blind, peeped
through the slats and waited. When the
sun-rays fell upon the spot close to the
window the little fellows began to come&mdash;each
with a morsel of food. They twittered
and hopped about as if they were
enjoying the morning fancy. Then they
scattered and took wings to chimneys,
cornices and wires. I opened the blinds
and looked out. I saw one lone, little

<h2 id="c9">THE WHITE-THROATED SPARROW.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Zonotrichia albicollis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The sparrows are all meek and lowly
birds.&rdquo; They are not clothed in a plumage
of gorgeous hues, but are endowed
with melodious voices in harmony with
their surroundings. &ldquo;Theirs are the
quaint lullaby songs of childhood.&rdquo; Their
plain coats are a means of protection, for
they frequent the fields, the hedges and
the low shrubs of the woodland borders.
Some of their relatives, the grosbeaks,
the goldfinch and the finches, are more
brilliantly colored and are more arboreal
in their habits.</p>
<p>The White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia
albicollis) is one of the handsomest
of the sparrows. It is one of the
exquisite parts of nature. Migratory in
habits, its range covers all of Eastern
North America, nesting from Michigan
and Massachusetts northward and wintering
from the latter state southward to
Florida.</p>
<p>Its scientific name is descriptive of the
marked color characteristics of its crown
and throat. Zonotrichia means hair or
crown bands, and albicollis is from the
Latin meaning white-throated. It is
sometimes called Peabody Bird, especially
by the New Englanders, with whom
Peabody is an important traditional
name, and they hear the birds say in its
song &ldquo;I&mdash;I Pea-body, Pea-body, Pea-body.&rdquo;
This rendering of its plaintive
song is a caricature, yet the name clings
to the bird even in other parts of the
country. The reserved manner of its
movements would hardly lead one to expect
that a beautiful song could flow
from its white throat. This song is so
well defined that the notation may be
written on the musical staff. Mr. Chapman
says: &ldquo;In September, when the
hedgerows and woodland undergrowths
begin to rustle with sparrows, juncos
and towhees, I watch eagerly for the arrival
of these welcome fall songsters.&rdquo;
We cannot forbear quoting the words of
that great student of bird life, Audubon,
who says of the White-Throat&rsquo;s
habit in autumn, &ldquo;How it comes and how
it departs are quite unknown to me. I
can only say that, all of a sudden, the
edges of the fields bordering on creeks or
swampy places and overgrown with different
species of vines, sumac bushes,
briers and the taller kinds of grasses, appear
covered with birds. They form
groups, sometimes containing from thirty
to fifty individuals, and live together
in harmony. They are constantly moving
up and down among these recesses, with
frequent jerkings of the tail, and uttering
a note common to the tribe. From
the hedges and thickets they issue one
by one, in quick succession, and ramble
to the distance of eight or ten yards, hopping
and scratching, in quest of small
seeds, and preserving the utmost silence.
When the least noise is heard or alarm
given, and frequently, as I thought, without
any alarm at all, they all fly back to
their covert, pushing directly into the
thickest part of it. A moment elapses,
when they become reassured, and ascending
to the highest branches and twigs
open a little concert, which, although of
short duration, is extremely sweet. There
is much plaintive softness in their note,
which I wish, kind reader, I could describe
to you; but this is impossible, although
it is yet ringing in my ears, as if
I were in those very fields where I have
so often listened to it with delight. No
sooner is their music over than they return
to the field, and thus continue alternately
sallying forth and retreating during
the greater part of the day. At the
approach of night they utter a sharper
note, consisting of a single twit, repeated
in a smart succession by the whole group,
and continuing until the first hooting of
some owl frightens them into silence.
Yet, often during fine nights I have heard
the little creatures emit, here and there,
a twit, as if to assure each other that all&rsquo;s
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nest, too, is a neat creation of
small roots, coarse grass, bark and moss
and lined with a bedding of fine grass
and moss. It is usually placed on the
ground in fields or open woods, where
it is protected by the taller grasses.
Sometimes, however, low bushes or the
lower branches of trees are selected.
So careful is the White-Throat in the
constructing of its nest not to disturb
the surrounding vegetation, and so neutral
is the color of the material used,
that one may hunt for a long time without
finding it unless he luckily stumbles
upon it.</p>
<h2 id="c10">A PLANT THAT MELTS ICE.</h2>
<p>To say that a plant can melt ice is to
assert a miracle seemingly too great for
even Nature&rsquo;s powers to compass, but a
traveler lately returned from the Alps
has witnessed this wonderful phenomenon,
while Grant Allen and other authorities
confirm the fact that the Alpine Soldanella
melts for its blossom a passage
through the ice by power of its own internal
heat.</p>
<p>The majority of tourists visit the Alps
in August; therefore they miss a rare
sight, that of a daring little shrub opening
its fringed blue buds in the very middle
of the snow sheet, and often showing
its slender head above a layer of ice,
in the most incredible fashion.</p>
<p>We may regard the Alps as unpeopled
solitudes, but to Alpine plants they are a
veritable world of competing life types.</p>
<p>Those only fitted for the struggle survive.</p>
<p>The botanists tell us that the Soldanella
is heavily handicapped in the race. In
the first place, it is obliged to eke out a
livelihood in the mountain belt just below
the snow line; further, it is a very
low growing variety, and is quickly obscured
and overtopped by the dense and
rapid growth of its taller rivals; hence its
anxiety to seize its one chance in life at
the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>To attain the end of its being, the perpetuation
of its species, it must steal a
march upon its companions, as it were,
and show itself while they are still locked
in sleep, and when its insect fertilizers,
fresh from their cocoons, can see and
visit it.</p>
<p>To accomplish its purpose it has made
ample preparations.</p>
<p>All through the previous summer its
round leaves, admirably fitted to their
purpose, have been spread to the mountain
sun and gathered in the fuel to be
burned later on.</p>
<p>When winter arrives the leaves had
grown thick in rich material and so leathery
that no amount of snow could injure
them.</p>
<p>The first warmth of spring melting
the edges of the snow sheet sends the
moisture trickling down to the Soldanella&rsquo;s
roots. This, acting upon them as
water upon malting barley, brings about
germination.</p>
<p>The plant, absorbing the oxygen in the
air under the ice and combining it with
the fuel in its own substance, melts its
way into the open air. A fragile flower
forcing its way through a solid crust of
ice. Literally, not metaphorically, a slow
combustion store.</p>
<p>This novel feat is accomplished every
season, yet comparatively few observers
note it.</p>

</div>
<p>and their writings lack the glamour of
his &ldquo;glossy, varying dyes;&rdquo; for, according
to Lesson, the first mention which is made
of hummingbirds in the narratives of adventurers
who proceeded to America, not
with the design of studying its natural
productions, but for the discovery of gold,
dates from 1558.</p>
<p>Of the name hummingbird or hum-bird,
Professor Newton says its earliest
use, as yet discovered, is said to be by
Thomas Morton in The New England
Canaan, printed in 1632, while in 1646
Sir Thomas Browne wrote: &ldquo;So have
all Ages conceaved, and most are still
ready to sweare, the Wren is the least of
Birds, yet the discoveries of America,
and even of our own Plantations, shewed
us one farre lesse, that is the Hum-bird,
not much exceeding a Beetle.&rdquo; Mr. Ridgway
cites the case of Mr. Benjamin Buttivant,
writing from Boston in 1697, who
told of a hum-bird that he fed with honey,
that was &ldquo;A Prospect to many Comers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earliest notice of the common
Ruby-throat that I have been able to
find,&rdquo; Mr. Ridgway continues, &ldquo;is an extract
from a letter written from Boston
in New England, October 26, 1670, by
John Winthrop, Esq., governor of Connecticut,
to Francis Willoughby, Esq.,
and published in the philosophical Transactions.&rdquo;
This letter reads as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send you withal, a little Box, with
a Curiosity in it, which perhaps will be
counted a trifle, yet &rsquo;tis rarely to be met
with, even here. It is the curiously contrived
nest of the Humming-Bird, so
called from the humming noise it maketh
as it flies. &rsquo;Tis an exceeding little Bird,
and only seen in Summer, and mostly in
gardens, flying from flower, sucking Honey
out of the flowers as the Bee doth;
as it flieth not lighting on the flower, but
hovering over it, sucking with its long
Bill a sweet substance. There are in the
same Nest two of that Bird&rsquo;s eggs.
Whether they used to have more at once
I know not. I never saw but one of
these Nests before, and that was sent
over formerly with some other Rarities,
but the vessel miscarrying, you received
them not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the long bill with which it sucketh
the sweet substance, the tongue is the essential
feature, so far as sustenance is
concerned; consisting of a long double
cylinder, &ldquo;like a double-barreled gun,&rdquo;
Goodrich thought&mdash;a most convenient instrument
for imbibing nectar&mdash;flattened
and sometimes barbed at the end, for the
capture of the minute insects that constitute
the less &aelig;sthetic portion of their
nutriment&mdash;for it has been many times
demonstrated that, airy and fairy as they
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
are (the size of the stomach not exceeding
the globe of the eye, and scarcely a
sixth part as large as the heart, which, in
turn, is remarkably large, nearly the size
of the cranium), they cannot live by ambrosia
alone, nor yet by love, but must
vary both with an occasional relish of
aphides and infinitesimal spiders.</p>
<p>Of &ldquo;that Bird&rsquo;s two eggs,&rdquo; Mr. Chapman
says: &ldquo;As far as known, all hummingbirds
lay two white eggs&mdash;frail,
pearly ellipses&mdash;that after ten days&rsquo; incubation
develop into a tangle of dark limbs
and bodies, which no one could think of
calling birds, much less winged gems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been a matter of doubt to many
whether hummingbirds ever rested at all
or spent their lives in the air exclusively,
but Mr. Gould states authoritatively:
&ldquo;Although many short intermissions of
rest are taken during the day, the bird
may be said to live in the air&mdash;an element
in which it performs every kind of evolution
with the utmost ease, frequently
rising perpendicularly, flying backwards,
pirouetting or dancing off, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the belief of the Duke of Argyle
that no bird could fly backward, a theory
that he stated with emphasis in his Reign
of Law, but it has been proved that he
reckoned without &ldquo;the winglet of the
fairy hummingbird,&rdquo; which seems to be
the exception to prove a reigning law of
Nature.</p>
<p>Montgomery makes of the whole Trochilid&aelig;
family this inspired explanation:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Art thou a bird, a bee, or butterfly?</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Each and all three;&mdash;a bird</p>
<p class="t0">A bee collecting sweets from bloom to bloom,</p>
<p class="t0">A butterfly in brilliancy of plume.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The blooms from which he collects his
sweets are of the tubular flowers almost
exclusively, as a mark, possibly, of his
appreciation of their invention for him
and at his request, as told by Albert Bigelow
Paine:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The clover, said the humming-bird,</p>
<p class="t0">Was fashioned for the bee,</p>
<p class="t0">But ne&rsquo;er a flower, as I have heard,</p>
<p class="t0">Was ever made for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A passing zephyr paused, and stirred</p>
<p class="t0">Some moonlit drops of dew</p>
<p class="t0">To earth; and for the humming-bird</p>
<p class="t0">The honeysuckle grew.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Of his manner of hanging before his
tubular flowers Goodrich says: &ldquo;He
poises or suspends himself on wing for
the space of two or three seconds so
steadily that his wings become invisible
and you can plainly discern the pupil of
his eye, looking round with great quickness
and circumspection. The glossy
green of his back and the fire of his
throat, dazzling in the sun, form altogether
a most interesting appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This appearance Alexander Wilson
pictures thus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;While richest roses though in crimson drest,</p>
<p class="t0">Spring from the splendors of his gorgeous breast.</p>
<p class="t0">What heavenly tints in mingling radiance fly!</p>
<p class="t0">Each rapid movement gives a different dye;</p>
<p class="t0">Like scales of burnished gold they dazzling show,</p>
<p class="t0">Now sink to shade, now like a furnace glow!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is little wonder that Buffon exclaimed,
&ldquo;Nature has loaded it with all
the gifts of which she has only given other
birds a share!&rdquo; Yet Mr. Ridgway
considers the Count de Buffon&rsquo;s laudation
as excessive because the &ldquo;absence of
melodious voice is, as a rule, a conspicuous
deficiency of the tribe&rdquo;; and in 1693
Mr. Hammersley of Coventry stated,
&ldquo;God, in many of his creatures, is bountiful,
but not lavish, for I did observe the
hummingbirds for several years, and never
heard them sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goldsmith says that all travelers agree
that they have a little interrupted chirrup,
but Labat asserts that they have a
most pleasing melancholly melody in their
voices, though small and proportioned to
the organs that produce it.</p>
<p>It is known that a few of the more robust
species of Jamaica and Mexico warble
a pigmy melody, and Mr. Gosse says
that the Vervain hummingbird of Jamaica
is the only one known to him that has
a real song, warbling in a very weak but
very sweet tone a continuous melody for
ten minutes at a time.</p>
<p>But the poet Rogers apprehended
something more than is perceptible to the
scientific consciousness, for he exclaims
in The Voyage of Columbus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&mdash;There quivering rise</p>
<p class="t0">Wings that reflect the glow of evening skies!</p>
<p class="t0">Half bird, half fly, the fairy king of flowers</p>
<p class="t0">Reigns there, and revels through the fragrant hours;</p>
<p class="t0">Gem full of life and joy and <i>song divine</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Could the compressed, intense, vehement
little sprite be expanded to the dimensions
of the ordinary folk of air,
would the magnified musical and physical
representation be as entrancing as are the
fleeting glimpses of the fairy and the
elusive hints of melody that so nearly
escape us now?</p>
<p>For this electric spark, like an erratic
meteorite of topaz and ruby and gold,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t10">&ldquo;As if inlaid</p>
<p class="t0">With brilliants from the mine, or made</p>
<p class="t0">Of tearless rainbows, such as span</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; unclouded skies of Peristan,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>hovering between heaven and earth in a
mist created by its own prismatic wings,
might almost be believed an exemplification
of light itself as scientifically defined,
&ldquo;a form of radiant energy,&rdquo; and it is the
nearest approach to a disembodied spirit
that lies within the range of mortal vision.
So while it is believed that its song
is but a feeble twittering, it may yet be
as much musician as it is bird, and emit
strains of melody too exquisite and finely
drawn for human apprehension, and of
which the notes that reach us are but the
deeper tones of a delicate and etherial
ariose.</p>

<p class="lr">&mdash;James Russell Lowell.</p>
</div>
<p>The Parula or Blue Yellow-backed
Warbler, as it is sometimes called, is one
of the smallest and daintiest representatives
of the family of wood warblers.
Like the other species of warblers it is
one of the last spring migrants to reach
its Northern summer home. Retiring
and unobtrusive in its habits, it is to be
admired for its &ldquo;plain and modest beauty.&rdquo;
Though delicately colored, its plumage
is not nearly so striking as that of
many of the other species of the family.
It enjoys the higher branches of its woodland
retreat, and here it seeks its food.
Graceful in all its motions, it flits from
branch to branch; hanging by its feet,
it peers under the leaves and along the
twigs.</p>
<p>In the summer the Parula is a resident
of Eastern North America, but in the
winter it seeks the warmer climate of
Florida and southward. While migrating
it is well distributed over its range,
and may frequently be seen flying from
shrub to shrub. Like the other warblers
its flights are short and most of the time
it is hidden by the foliage. The longer
flights are by night. The days are spent
in seeking insects, upon which it feeds
almost exclusively. This, the habit of all
the warblers, explains the Parula&rsquo;s sudden
disappearance from a locality where
it may have been common for a single
day.</p>
<p>Near the end of May it retires to the
swampy woodlands where the gray Spanish
moss hangs pendant from the branches
and shrubs. Here the Parula makes
its nest, a globular or pencil home, usually
in bunches of the festooned moss.
The four or five white eggs are marked
near the larger end with specks of light
brown and lilac. Its song is neither interesting
nor striking, but is peculiarly
in harmony with the voices of spring
and as Mr. Chapman says: &ldquo;When the
cypresses are enveloped in a haze of
lace-like blossoms and the woods are
fragrant with the delicious odor of yellow
jasmine, the dreamy softness of the
air is voiced by the Parula&rsquo;s drowsy
song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neltje Blanchan has most charmingly
written about this dainty bird. She says:
&ldquo;A number of such airy, tiny beauties
flitting about among the blossoms of the
shrubbery on a bright May morning and
swaying on the slenderest branches with
their inimitable grace, is a sight that
the memory should retain into old age.
They seem the very embodiment of life,
joy, beauty, grace; of everything lovely
that birds by any possibility could be.
Apparently they are wafted about the
garden; they fly with no more effort
than a dainty lifting of the wings, as if
to catch the breeze that seems to lift
them as it might a bunch of thistledown.
They go through a great variety of
charming posturings as they hunt for
their food upon the blossoms and tender,
fresh twigs, now creeping like a nuthatch
along the bark and peering into the crevices,
now gracefully swaying and balancing
like a goldfinch upon a slender,
pendant stem. One little sprite pauses in
its hunt for insects to raise its pretty
head and trill a short and wiry song.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c14">A DAINTY LOVER.</h2>
<p>All animal life is wonderful and much
of it is beautiful, but it seems to me there
can be nothing prettier or more subtle
in all the immense accumulation of the
folk lore of human courtship and marriage
than the following practice of a certain
Mexican bird.</p>
<p>He belongs to a rarely beautiful species
of the Paradise family.</p>
<p>To shield the privacy of his wooing
and wedding he builds a dainty little
cone-shaped hut, about which he contrives
a marvelous little landscape garden.</p>
<p>First he makes a sward of green moss
and beds and parterres of crimson berries,
tiny bright flowers and gold and
silver sand and grains. Here and there
he puts a pearly pebble or tiny pink shell.
And so long as his love making lasts he
drags away and replaces each flower as
it fades, keeping the little Eden tidy, gay
and sweet for his tiny love.</p>
<p>This sounds like fiction, but is scientific
fact.</p>

<h2 id="c15">A BIRD NOTE.</h2>
<p>Robin Feeding Young: Scene, the
base of a large pine tree in the corner of
a lawn; actors, a mother robin and two
of her young.</p>
<p>I was much interested in their proceedings
and watched them for some time.
One of the young ones did not seem to
understand matters very clearly and often
failed to do what mother robin wished it
to. The other one, however, was a very
apt pupil, and did many bright things.
Finally it began to gather food on its own
account and succeeded in capturing several
worms, small butterflies, etc. But it
did not stop here; it remembered its nest
mate, and, following the example of the
mother bird, collected food and placed it
in the mouth of the less active learner.
A very good example of how closely parents
are imitated, in the bird world, as
well as in the human subject.</p>
<p>The above incident as witnessed and
recorded in the writer&rsquo;s note book, seem
too good to be lost sight of, and I trust
they may prove of interest to all.</p>

<h2 id="c18">TOURMALINE.</h2>
<p>Early in the eighteenth century some
children of Holland, playing on a warm
summer&rsquo;s day in a court yard with a few
bright colored stones, noticed that these
possessed a strange power when warmed
by the heat of the sun. They attracted
and held (just as a magnet attracts iron)
ashes, straws and bits of paper. On reporting
this strange discovery to their
parents the latter, it is said, could give
no explanation of the curious property,
but a relic of their knowledge of it is
left in the name of &ldquo;aschentreckers&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ash-drawers&rdquo; which they gave the
stones and by which they were known for
a long time.</p>
<p>Such was the method of introduction
to the civilized world of the mineral now
known as Tourmaline, a mineral which
in variety of color, composition and properties
is one of the most interesting in
Nature.</p>
<p>The lapidaries who had given the
Dutch children the stones for playthings
did not recognize them as different from
the other gems in which they were accustomed
to deal. So to the present day,
although Tourmaline is considerably used
in jewelry, it is rarely ever called by that
name. The green varieties are often
known as Brazilian Emerald, Chrysolite
or Peridot, some varieties of blue as Brazilian
Sapphire, others as Indicolite, the
colorless as Achroite, and the red as Rubellite,
Siberite, and even as Ruby.</p>
<p>It is only somewhat recently that these
different stones have been recognized as
being varieties of a single mineral species
which is known by the name Tourmaline.
This name comes from a Cingalese
word (turamali) which was applied
to the first Tourmaline gems sent from
Ceylon to Holland.</p>
<p>At one time the name Schorl was
chiefly applied to the species. This was
before the means of distinguishing mineral
species were as well understood as
they are now, and a large number of minerals
and even rocks were included under
the name Schorl. One by one, however,
they were distinguished by separate
names until Schorl included only Tourmaline,
and shortly afterward the name
Schorl was dropped altogether.</p>
<p>In its opaque form, colored either black
or brown, Tourmaline is a comparatively
common mineral. It accompanies many
so-called metamorphic rocks, i. e., rocks
which have been changed by heat and
pressure from their original condition,
and is also common in granite and other
eruptive rocks. As a rock forming mineral
it often occurs as long, slender
prisms, frequently about the size of a
darning needle and radiating in all directions.
The only mineral for which it is
likely to be mistaken in this form is
Hornblende. It can be distinguished from
this in the following manner: On fusing
the powdered mineral with a mixture of
bisulphate of potash and fluor spar (best
done on a little loop of platinum wire)
Tourmaline will color the flame green,
while Hornblende will produce no coloration.</p>
<p>The black opaque crystals often reach
a large size, as some are known to be
four feet in length. Both black and
brown Tourmaline are usually opaque,
and hence have no value as gems. The
Tourmalines available for gems are transparent
and have a great variety of color.</p>
<p>The gem Tourmalines are to be found
in only a few localities. They occur in
Maine, Connecticut and California in our
own country, and also in Brazil, Russia
and Ceylon. The crystals are usually in
the form of long, slender prisms. They
often have the peculiarity of being differently
colored in different portions. Thus
a crystal may be green at one end and
red at the other, and in cross section may
show a blue center, then a colorless zone,
then one of red and then one of green.
Some of the crystals from Paris, Me.,
change from white at one termination to
emerald green, then light green, then
pink, and finally are colorless at the other
termination. In some crystals again the
red passes to blue, the blue to green and
the green to black.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Exactly what produces these differences
of color is not known. It is known
that black Tourmaline has an excess of
iron, the red and green an excess of sodium
and lithium, and the yellow and
brown an excess of magnesium in their
composition. These same differences of
composition characterize similar colors in
portions of the same crystal as well as
separate crystals. Hence the evidence is
quite conclusive that the color in some
way depends on the composition. Many
transparent Tourmalines, while appearing
of a uniform color when viewed
in any one direction, exhibit different colors
when viewed in different directions.
Thus, one of the long, slender crystals
may appear green when held lengthwise
in front of the eye, but when looked at
from the end appears brown. Again,
some crystals appear perfectly transparent
when viewed perpendicularly to the
sides of the prism, but when viewed from
the end are perfectly opaque. This may
be true even when the thickness is less
in the latter direction. Both these properties
are due to the arrangement of the
molecules of Tourmaline, which is such
as to make the power of absorbing light
different in different directions.</p>
<p>The form of crystals of Tourmaline is
usually that of a three-sided prism. The
sides of the prism are usually marked by
narrow parallel lines called stri&aelig;, and the
prism may be more or less rounded by
the addition of other planes.</p>
<p>If a doubly terminated crystal be examined
carefully, it will be seen that
the planes on the two ends are not alike,
either in number or inclination. On one
end there may be three planes, on the other
six, or even twelve. If the planes on
one end make a blunt termination, those
on the other may make a sharply pointed
one. Such a peculiarity of crystal form
is possessed by but few minerals. Those
possessing it are said to be hemimorphic,
i. e., half formed. In such minerals it
is evident that the forces of attraction by
which the molecules were arranged differed
in character at one end from those
at the other. In other words, a separation
of the molecular forces seems to have
taken place, one kind going to one end
and the other force to the opposite end.
Now, it is a curious fact that most crystals
which exhibit this peculiarity of form
are also pyroelectric, i. e., become electric
on heating. It was this development of
electricity which caused the stones with
which the Dutch children played, to pick
up ashes, paper, etc., when the stones
were warmed by the heat of the sun.
Anyone can repeat their observation by
gently heating crystals or even fragments
of Tourmaline and applying them to bits
of paper. The electrical attraction will
often be found to be very strong, though
it varies with different crystals. The
fragments should not be overheated, the
electricity being most strongly developed
between 100 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
A study of the kinds of electricity developed
by the heat shows that positive electricity
is produced at one end and negative
at the other. Now, this exactly corresponds
with what we have seen of the
form of the crystal, and shows that the
polar arrangement of the molecules producing
different shapes at the two ends,
also produces corresponding electrical
properties. Crystal form, heat, electricity,
and even light, are therefore seen to
have intimate connection, and it may be
that this interesting mineral will furnish
us a means of learning more about these
forces.</p>
<p>In composition Tourmaline is a complex
silicate chiefly of aluminum and
boron. Iron, magnesium, the alkalies,
and water also enter in varying amounts
into it. In fact, so complicated is its
chemical nature that perhaps no other
mineral has been so often analyzed or had
its analyses so much discussed.</p>
<p>Ruskin, in his &ldquo;Ethics of the Dust,&rdquo;
thus describes its composition: &ldquo;A little
of everything; there&rsquo;s always flint and
clay and magnesia in it; and the black is
iron according to its fancy; and there&rsquo;s
boracic acid, if you know what that is,
and if you don&rsquo;t, I cannot tell you to-day,
and it doesn&rsquo;t signify; and there&rsquo;s
potash and soda, and, on the whole, the
chemistry of it is more like a medi&aelig;val
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
doctor&rsquo;s prescription than the making of
a respectable mineral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to its hardness and specific gravity,
Tourmaline may be said to be both harder
and heavier than quartz, its hardness
being 7-7.5 in the scale of hardness of
which the diamond is 10. Its specific
gravity is 2.98-3.20. These qualities fit
it admirably for use as a gem. It is, however,
quite brittle and even at times friable.
Cracks therefore frequently cut
across good crystals and spoil what would
otherwise make a good gem. It is very
common to find tourmalines in the rocks
broken into a number of pieces and the
fragments &ldquo;mended&rdquo; together with
quartz or calcite. This has been true of
the black Tourmaline shown in the accompanying
plate. Scarcely any other
mineral exhibits this change so often
as Tourmaline, a result due probably
to its brittleness and the character
of the rock in which it occurs.</p>
<p>I have shown how one of the most remarkable
properties of Tourmaline was
discovered by children. It is also interesting
to know that the locality of the
finest Tourmalines in the world was discovered
by two boys named Elijah L.
Hamlin and Ezekiel Holmes. They were
interested in the study of minerals and
spent much of their leisure time searching
for them. One day in the fall, having
been out many hours hunting for new
minerals, they were about to return home
when a gleam of something green at the
roots of a tree caught their eye. Eagerly
bringing it to light, they found it to be a
beautiful green Tourmaline. A fall of
snow that night prevented their obtaining
more of the crystals, but the following
spring they returned and secured
many fine gems. For many years thereafter
the locality furnished gems of
purest ray serene which have gone to
adorn the coronets of kings and enriched
the mineral cabinets of the world.</p>
<p>It is estimated that fifty thousand dollars&rsquo;
worth of Tourmalines have been
taken from this one locality. Auburn and
Rumford, Me., are two other neighboring
localities where good gems have been
found. At Haddam Neck, Conn., fine
transparent Tourmalines occur, generally
green in color, and many of them of gem
quality. They occur in a granite rock.</p>
<p>The red Tourmaline (Rubellite) from
California, illustrated in the accompanying
plate, is found in San Diego County
of that State. The matrix in which it
occurs is a lithia-bearing mica (lepidolite)
of a delicate violet color. In this
matrix the Tourmaline usually occurs in
radiating masses. The rose color of the
Tourmaline contrasting with the violet of
the lepidolite makes an object which is
quite a favorite with mineral fanciers,
although the former is not sufficiently
transparent to be used as a gem. At two
other localities in the same State large
transparent Tourmalines of varying colors
have been found.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Tourmalines are chiefly
green in color. They occur in connection
with blue and white topaz. They are the
source of the gem known as Brazilian
Emerald, which has not, however, the
value of the true emerald.</p>
<p>The Tourmalines from the island of
Elba are generally red in color, transparent
and well crystallized. They are, however,
too small to use as gems.</p>
<p>The Ceylon Tourmalines occur in the
gem gravels of that locality accompanying
rubies, sapphires, etc., while those of
Russia, chiefly red in color, come from
the Ural Mountains, being found in company
with amethyst, topaz, beryl and other
gems.</p>

<h2 id="c19">THE STAR FISH.</h2>
<p>One of the most common objects found
along our New England sea coast is the
star fish, called by the seamen &ldquo;Five-fingered
Jack.&rdquo; The fact of its being
common does not at all imply that its
habits are commonly known. The great
difficulty of watching it in its native
haunts has been a drawback to getting
better acquainted with it, but when taken
to an aquarium it has been found to be
an exceedingly interesting little star. At
low tide you may find hundreds of them
clinging to the rocks, sea moss or on the
sandy bottom, but they prefer deep water.
Their color varies from a dark rich
brown to a reddish, and often a chocolate
shade, sometimes lighter; but no matter
the shade, they are always attractive.</p>
<p>The upper side is slightly convex,
rough and tuberculous; the under side
is soft and contains all the vital and locomotory
organs. Immediately upon being
taken from the water the soft under parts
seem to shrink away and nothing substantial
remains but the upper surface.
This is perforated with pores, through
which the water enters to all parts of
the body by channels. Very near the
center is a small opening through which
the water is admitted to a strong, rather
elastic, tube, which is encircled by a series
of rings. Now turn the star fish
over and you can see that this tube opens
into a ring about the mouth, while similar
tubes stretch out to the arms. From these
cross tubes little fibers extend, terminating
in discs. These are the true organs
of locomotion, and are called ambulacra.
They move very slowly and are not at
all clumsy, but have even been called
graceful by some naturalists.</p>
<p>A portion of these ambulacra are made
fast by suction while the rest of the body
is drawn forward; then the first are relaxed
and the process repeated, thus they
travel in the deep waters.</p>
<p>It is quite evident that the five bright
red eyes at the tip of each ray are of
some use in helping them on their journeys;
but just how much they can see is
not quite known. When a large object appears
before them they prepare to surmount
it, often going up very steep sides
and down again as easily as though on a
level stretch, often standing on the tip of
one ray and sometimes on the five, thus
resembling a five-legged stool.</p>
<p>The heart, situated near the opening on
the back, is supplied with a set of blood
vessels. They also have respiratory organs
and a nervous system, but, judging
from the manner they endure vivisection,
their nervous system must be of a very
low order, for if they are broken in pieces
the missing parts will soon grow again&mdash;in
fact, they do not seem to be disturbed
in the least no more than if it were a cast-off
garment, and evidently go about as
happy with the remaining rays as with
the complete body, and, what is still more
strange, the broken ray will grow a complete
set of arms and a new body. This
is one way of reproduction, so if you wish
to kill a star fish don&rsquo;t break it in pieces.
The only sure way of making an end
to their lives is to drop them in fresh water,
when they immediately die.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to watch them
care for their eggs. These are kept in
pouches at the base of the rays, and when
emitted through an opening there provided,
are actually brooded as a hen her
chicks, by arching the central part of the
body and bending the rays down, and if
the eggs are scattered they take great
pains to collect them again, often traveling
long distances for them.</p>
<p>The star fish consumes a large amount
of food; you would hardly think one
stomach could care for so much, but each
ray has an additional stomach, and all
need food. Their favorite food is the
whelk, a small black-shelled, snail-like
mollusk. Indeed, they eat many varieties
of the mollusk.</p>
<p>They are also very fond of oysters.
You would be interested to watch the
star fish as he slowly works his way
along until directly over the oyster, then
folds his five arms around it, holding it
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
firmly in place, then pushing out his stomach,
through his mouth, he wraps it
around the unfortunate oyster, and by the
power of suction the oyster is drawn
from the shell and digested and the shell
cast away. You can easily see what a
nuisance they must be in an oyster bed.</p>
<p>They are known as the opossum of the
sea, as they often appear to be quite dead
when they are very much alive. If you
wish to be sure, put him on his back, and
if alive you will soon see a number of
semitransparent globular objects beginning
to move, reaching this way and that.
These are the ambulacra seeking to regain
their normal position. If you see
no motion, you may safely conclude that
he is an extinguished star.</p>

<p class="caption">INDIAN OR ASIATIC ELEPHANT.
<br />(Elephas asiaticus.)</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c21">THE INDIAN ELEPHANT.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Elephas indicus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Indian Elephant (<i>Elephas indicus</i>)
inhabits the wooded parts of Southern
Asia from the Himalayas to the Indian
Ocean, and is found throughout
Burmah, Siam and the Malay Peninsula.
It differs from the African Elephant in
having much smaller ears, a concave instead
of convex forehead, smaller tusks,
and in the possession of a finger on the
end of the proboscis which, working
against a tubercle on the lower part of the
trunk, serves many of the purposes of
the human hand.</p>
<p>The proboscis, which is an extension
and enlargement of the nose and upper
lip, is composed of as many as forty
thousand interlacing muscles, and is
capable of the most delicate and varied
manipulation. At times it is used to strip
twigs and leaves from overhanging trees,
or again to uproot bamboo shoots or to
pluck grass and plants from the ground,
carrying all to the ever-grinding jaws behind.
By sucking it full of water the
Elephant may give himself a shower bath
or squirt water into his mouth or even
over people who offend him.</p>
<p>The presence of the trunk and tusks
has greatly modified the cranium of the
Elephant. Although a very intelligent
animal, his brain is relatively small in
proportion to his immense size. The
great, rounded humps which crown an
Elephant&rsquo;s head are composed of bony
air cells, and their function is to provide
surface for the supporting muscles of the
trunk. So thick are these bony processes
that they will stop a rifle ball; and on the
other hand Elephants have been shot
through the skull without the least injury
to the brain.</p>
<p>The tusks, which are often lacking in
Asiatic Elephants, especially in the females,
are the incisors of the upper jaw,
grown straight out, and serve primarily
as weapons, although in domesticated
animals they are used to dig and lift and
to carry heavy burdens. Besides these
teeth the Elephant has four large molars,
two in each jaw, and he is able to chew
from four to eight hundred pounds of
green fodder a day with them. In a
wild state the Elephants wander about in
bands through the forests, following their
leader from feeding grounds to water,
and concern themselves largely with eating
and drinking and escaping from their
enemies. The young weigh about two
hundred pounds at birth, and attain to
over eight thousand pounds at thirty
years, when they have reached maturity.
At sixty an Elephant is counted in his
prime, and many live to be a hundred or
even a hundred and fifty years old. Eleven
feet is the extreme height of the
Asiatic Elephant. His specific gravity is
so great that in swimming rivers his
whole body disappears below the surface;
but this gives him no trouble, as he
breathes by thrusting the tip of his trunk
above the water and can surge up enough
to get one eye out when he wishes to see
where he is going.</p>
<p>The eyes are small and, probably on
account of living in the forest so much,
they are not very sharp-sighted. This
defect is counterbalanced by very acute
hearing and sense of smell. In browsing
the Elephant is probably guided altogether
by touch and his sense of smell;
and in a dark forest even very sharp eyes
are of little value either in selecting food
or detecting enemies, especially in an animal
with so short and heavy a neck.</p>
<p>The feet of an Elephant are great elastic
cushions with which he passes noiselessly
through the jungles. When he
chooses to stand still it is almost impossible
to distinguish his brown skin
from the foliage with which he is surrounded.
But an animal as large and
strong as the Elephant does not need to
conceal himself, except from man, his
great enemy, and when a troop of Elephants
wish to pass from one place to another
they often charge through the jungles
and forest, smashing down trees and
vines and leaving a broad trail behind
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
them. When disturbed or wounded by
hunters they rush furiously through the
thickets after their tormentors, and if
they fail to catch and crush them in the
first charge it has often happened that
Elephants have returned and smelled
them out as a dog scents a rabbit.</p>
<p>On account of the slow growth of
young Elephants it has been found more
satisfactory in India to catch wild Elephants
than to breed them in captivity
and wait fifteen years for the young to
reach maturity and usefulness. The plan
usually pursued is to build a huge corral
in a tract of forest where wild Elephants
roam, usually across an Elephant path.
Where the path enters the corral a heavy
gate is made and suspended over the way,
so that it can be instantly dropped and
fastened. Then, when a herd of wild
Elephants wanders near enough to the
trap on the gate side an army of native
beaters is hastily gathered and the troop
is surrounded on three sides. Each beater
is provided with a tom-tom or torch,
and in the confusion of shouting and
torch-waving the whole herd is driven
into the enclosure. At first they charge
the stockade wildly, and the natives rush
from side to side, resisting their attacks
with fire and uproar. When at last they
stand huddled together in the middle of
the enclosure tame Elephants are driven
in and allowed to mix freely with the
wild ones. Cautiously they single out an
Elephant, surround him and hold him in
place, while men called noosers slip quietly
down from the backs of the tame Elephants
and fasten strong, soft ropes
about his feet, after which he is marched
out of the corral between two Elephants
and tamed to work as they work, carrying
heavy loads, dragging and piling timber,
or perhaps marching in the splendid processions
of Eastern kings.</p>

<h2 id="c23">TOPSY.</h2>
<p>Ethel Tyler has a tame crow for a pet.
It is so black and such a mischievous
creature that Ethel named her Topsy.</p>
<p>Topsy was quite small when given to
Ethel, and she has learned to say a number
of words.</p>
<p>There is a large orchard back of the
house, and Topsy seems to think this her
special playground. Here she can play
about and &ldquo;caw&rdquo; to her heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>She loves to hide among the branches
of a tree, then call, &ldquo;Ethel, Ethel,&rdquo; expecting
Ethel to come and hunt for her.</p>
<p>Topsy is very amusing, for there is no
end to her tricks and pranks, but she can
also be very troublesome if she is so disposed.</p>
<p>Her greatest fault is that of stealing.
Small articles, as keys, thimbles, spools
of thread and such things have to be kept
where she cannot get at them or they
will be missing.</p>
<p>Her eyes are quick and she is so sly
that she generally gets away with the
things without being caught.</p>
<p>When articles are missed, we know
whom to blame, but it is quite another
thing to find them, for she seldom uses
a hiding place after it has once been discovered
and her plunder removed.</p>
<p>There is one member of the Tyler family
that has not a high opinion of Topsy,
and that is Tony, Ethel&rsquo;s cat.</p>
<p>Topsy does her part towards making
the poor cat&rsquo;s life miserable, and I guess
Tony thinks she is quite successful.</p>
<p>She tips over his saucer of milk, pecks
at his tail, swoops down upon him when
he is eating, seizes his meat and flies to
a place of safety before Tony realizes
that he has been robbed. Topsy then
proceeds to eat her booty, chattering to
herself as though she had done a brave
deed.</p>
<p>Tony stands in fear of Topsy, and she
knows it, and is not slow in taking advantage
of the knowledge whenever an
opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>When Topsy calls, &ldquo;Tony, Tony,&rdquo; the
cat lengthens the distance between himself
and the artful crow, for he knows by
experience that she only wants the tuft
of fur at the tip of his tail or a piece of
the rim of his ear.</p>
<p>There is no trouble about feeding Topsy.
As long as she has plenty to eat it
does not matter what the food might be
and she never stops to inquire whether it
is fresh or not.</p>
<p>She is very fond of fish, and it is amusing
to watch her when a fish cart comes
along.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tyler patronizes a certain man
that sells fish, and he stops in front of the
house and blows his horn so that she
will know he is there. Topsy has learned
to associate the blast from the horn with
&ldquo;fish,&rdquo; and the minute she hears a horn
blown she starts for the street.</p>
<p>She always receives a piece of fish if it
is Mrs. Tyler&rsquo;s fish monger that is passing,
but it often happens that it is a
stranger going by and then Topsy follows
the cart down the street to see if he
will not throw her a piece of fish. If he
does not, she comes back chattering angrily
at being cheated out of so enjoyable
a meal.</p>
<p>Ethel will call, &ldquo;Topsy, Topsy,&rdquo; and
the crow will come hopping to her.
&ldquo;Shake hands,&rdquo; and Topsy will raise one
of her black feet and put it in Ethel&rsquo;s
hand for her to shake.</p>
<p>When Topsy wishes to go into the
house she stands on the door step and
calls, &ldquo;Mamma, Papa or Ethel&rdquo; until
some one comes and lets her in.</p>
<p>She has many opportunities to leave
the place and shift for herself, but she
never goes far from the house and seems
to prefer making her home with the Tyler
family.</p>

<h2 id="c24">THE WALRUS.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Trichechus rosmarus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Walrus (<i>Trichechus rosmarus</i>)
is a very fat, clumsy brute, much uglier
than his picture, with a coarse, oily skin
all wrinkled and scarred; long, protruding
tusks; bristly whiskers and scuffling
flippers that barely serve to move his
bulky body over the land. In the water
he is more at home, and though it does
not require a high degree of strength
and skill to dig clams, that being his
daily occupation, yet he is able to keep
very fat on the fruits of his industry and
has much leisure to swim about or doze
on ice floes and sea beaches.</p>
<p>It is only in the arctic regions that
Walrus are found. Before the attacks of
whalers and ivory hunters they were
found as far south as Nova Scotia and
the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but now they
have retreated as far as possible into the
frozen north, living in limited numbers
about Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, Davis Straits and
Greenland and in Spitzbergen and Northern
Europe. In the northern Pacific before
the slaughter began the Walrus
swarmed by thousands in the broad, shallow
bays from the Alaskan Peninsula to
Point Barrow, where the ice never melts.</p>
<p>The food of the Walrus consists of
mollusks and crustaceans, which he digs
from the muddy bottom with his long
tusks, and the roots and stalks of sea-weed.
He crushes the clams, shells and
all, and swallows the mass, leaving digestion
to proceed as it may. The stomach
of a Walrus killed in Bering Sea by Mr.
Henry W. Elliott contained more than
a bushel of crushed clams in their shells,
with enough other food to make half a
barrel.</p>
<p>It is principally for its ivory tusks and
the accumulated fat which comes from
heavy eating that the Walrus is now
being exterminated by whalers and hunters.
To the Eskimo the Walrus means
life itself. He eats the flesh, burns the
fat for fuel and light, makes his boats,
houses, harness and harpoon lines from
the hide and trades what ivory he has
not made into implements for the guns
and whisky so acceptable to primitive
man. The extermination of the Walrus
will probably mean the extermination of
the Eskimos, or at least an entire change
in their habits of life.</p>
<p>Although a very fierce looking animal,
the Walrus is reputed to be peaceful and
inoffensive except when attacked in the
water. At such times he has been known
to hook his tusks over the edge of the
boat and swamp it or even to call in his
friends by bull-like roars and smash the
boat to pieces. Besides man, his one
enemy is the polar bear, which creeps
upon him as he sleeps and worries him to
death. As the Walrus&rsquo; skin is anywhere
from half an inch to two inches thick and
padded out by an average of six inches
of fat, it is almost impossible to reach a
vital place even with long teeth and bear
claws, and the Walrus is often able to
flounder into the deep water and escape
by remaining under water until the bear
has to come up for breath.</p>
<p>One of the favorite amusements of the
Walrus is to float in the water with his
hind flippers hung down and his nose
comfortably above the wash and either
fall asleep or indulge in deep roarings
which are said to sound like something
between the mooing of a cow and the
baying of a mastiff and which often
serve, like whistling buoys, to warn sailors
from rocks and shoals.</p>
<p>The young are born in the spring, and
generally on the ice floes, but being born
fat the ice floes are probably as warm to
them as is a nest to a little mouse. The
mothers show great affection for their
young, and will not abandon them in
danger, even allowing themselves to be
speared while protecting their offspring.
As the Walrus are social by nature, wandering
about in great herds, and as they
also show a marked sympathy for each
other&rsquo;s misfortunes, it is very dangerous
to wound one in the water lest the whole
herd join in a common defense.</p>

<p class="caption">WALRUS.
<br />(Trichechus rosmarus.)</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>An adult male Walrus measures about
twelve feet from the end of his nose to
that of his very short tail, or fourteen feet
to the end of his hind flippers, and
weighs something over a ton. His girth is
as great as his length, in fact, it has been
often observed that his great circumference
and too-loose skin seem rather a
source of annoyance than otherwise to
him, especially when he tries to land on
a sandy beach. Even with the wash of
the breakers he is rarely able to get beyond
the water line, except as the tide
goes down and leaves him, dry perhaps,
but yet at the mercy of men and polar
bears.</p>

<h2 id="c25">TOUCHING INCIDENTS ABOUT PIGEONS.</h2>
<p>The homing pigeon has proved that
locality is a faculty fully developed in the
bird&rsquo;s little brain, but I heard, the other
day, an instance of memory in the species
that was most touching. A lady living
in the top story of a Boston skyscraper
had been in the habit of feeding
the pigeons and sparrows who flew to the
little balcony before her window, and had
succeeded in taming some of her pensioners,
one or two pigeons even eating
out of her hand. One day, while passing
along Park street, this lady was surprised
to see a pigeon flutter away from some
companions strutting in the middle of
the road, and come upon the sidewalk,
where it almost tripped her up in its efforts
to attract her attention. It fluttered
around her, evincing every sign of pleasure
and recognition, and when she called
it by name the little creature fairly flew
at her! Now, in the midst of all that
passing throng the pigeon knew its benefactor,
who, with tears in her eyes, says
its recognition gave her more joy than
if the queen had saluted her. Under the
circumstances, it was to her great regret
that she had no crumbs to give him then
and there. But who ever dreamed of being
accosted in the street by a pigeon?</p>
<p>Our attention has been called by a
traveling friend to an incident which occurred
recently in the family of G. F.
Marsh, a member of the Pacific Coast
Pigeon Society. It certainly proved to
him, and to all his friends in that region,
in a most impressive manner the valuable
services which may sometimes be rendered
by the carrier pigeon, and probably
explains some of his enthusiasm in
that direction. His little baby boy was
taken suddenly sick with most alarming
symptoms of diphtheria.</p>
<p>The mother, watching by the bedside
of the little one, dispatched a message
tied on a carrier pigeon to her husband
at his store on Market street, San Francisco.
In the message she wrote the nature
of the child&rsquo;s alarming illness, and
made an urgent appeal for medicine to
save its life. The bird was started from
the home of the family near the Cliff
House, five miles from Mr. Marsh&rsquo;s
store.</p>
<p>The bird flew swiftly to the store,
where Mr. Marsh received it. He read
the message, called a doctor, explained
the child&rsquo;s symptoms as his wife had detailed
them in her message, and received
the proper medicine. Then tying the little
vial containing the precious restorative
to the tail of the pigeon, he let it go.</p>
<p>The pigeon sped away swiftly through
the air straight for the Cliff. It made the
distance, five miles, in ten minutes, a distance
which would have required the doctor
three-quarters of an hour to cover.</p>
<p>In twenty minutes from the time the
mother&rsquo;s message was sent to her husband
the baby was taking the medicine.</p>
<p>Naturally enough Mr. Marsh is partial
to pigeons, for he considers that he owes
his baby&rsquo;s life to one.</p>

<h2 id="c26">ON THE SAN JOAQUIN.</h2>
<p>It was in the latter part of the month
of March that we started out from Fresno
for a day&rsquo;s outing on the San Joaquin
river, hunting for hawk and owl eggs.
The day was bright and warm, and we
keenly enjoyed the ride of nine miles
across the plains. Out past the old,
deserted Holland Colony, where stumps
of vines showed that the settlers had once
made an honest attempt to win their daily
bread out of the hard pan. The last
half of the way lay across the hog-wallow
country, that peculiar effect which has
puzzled many scientists, but which all
attribute to the action of water in long
past ages. The rolling motion of rising
over and descending these mounds was
like the riding of a small boat over the
waves of the sea. Here and there a burrow
in the top of one of the mounds, the
domicile of the frisky ground-squirrel or
the billy owl, gave the landscape the appearance
of a dish of mush cooking, with
the air bubbles swelling up, and some
bursting, leaving the little holes. On
across canals, past a wheat country, and
then the virginal hog-wallow lands that
no plowshare has ever touched, covered
with a short green growth which gives
nourishment to bands of sheep, dirty, and
with numerous lambkins, guarded by a
few sagacious shepherd dogs and lonely,
and equally dirty, bearded Mexican herders.</p>
<p>The mounds grow higher and the hollows
deeper until we wonder if they
stretch on forever and if we are lost
among them, when all at once we come
out right on the top of a high bluff overlooking
the San Joaquin. The unexpectedness
is quite startling. One could not
possibly have suspected a moment before
that we were within miles of a great river
bed more than a mile wide, with steep
bluffs more than 300 feet high on either
side and a swift river sweeping down its
channel in the center, but here we were
right on the edge of it. We can look
down almost perpendicularly and see,
three or four hundred feet below us, great
green meadows stretching to the north
and south and to the trees and thickets
that edge the river. The river from this
distance and height seems but a thread in
its once vast bed. What a sight&mdash;what
a power it must have been when once it
filled all this vast bed, which often is more
than a mile across from bluff to bluff.
On the further side a few trees grow
right on the edge of the water, and then
the bluff rises abruptly even higher than
on our side. Buzzards and hawks are
sweeping around us in the air, and dark
spots in the tops of far-off trees betoken
the presence of the objects of our search,
the nests of the hawks. We begin the
descent, which at first seems extremely
hazardous, and even on further trial sufficiently
steep to make walking down
more of a pleasure than riding, as we
find. The road or path winds around and
around, as necessarily it must unless one
would go head-first to the bottom. It is
narrow and steep and the ruts deeply
worn in places by the action of water.
About half way down we come upon
what was once a canal, and we can see
the level ridge of its embankment stretching
away above and below us along the
side of the bluff, as it curves in and out.
What a vast undertaking it must have
been to build this great waterway along
the face of the bluff. As we near the bottom
clumps of elderberry and scraggly
greasewood appear, and we come upon
two little white eggs of the dove, laid in
a hollow in the ground&mdash;an early bird
surely.</p>
<p>At last we are safely down in the valley
and across the meadow, which is one
vast bed of poppies, a field of the cloth
of gold. Then we come down among the
huge cottonwoods and river oaks that
line the river bank and unharness our
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
horse and tie him where the grazing is
good and then start on our search. We
first make our way down to the river&rsquo;s
edge and, lying flat on the sand and
rocks, drink to our content of the cool
water fresh from the snow of the Sierras.
The river is about five hundred feet
wide and varies from two hundred to a
thousand at this point. It is not high
now, for the spring floods come later,
with the melting of the snow, and in its
deepest part is not probably over eight
or ten feet, but it is swift&mdash;terribly swift.
It is a good swimmer that can hold his
own with the current for five minutes,
and in the swiftest part it is impossible
for a man to make any headway. The
bottom is of shifting sand and the channel
is ever changing. It is a deceitful
and treacherous river, though laughing
and sparkling in the sun to-day. It has
taken value for value for all the gold it
has given up. Here and there in the
deep places under the shadow of the bank
we can see catfish and big carp moving
lazily about. The catfish and a fish known
as the river trout can be caught with a
hook and line, but the carp never touches
bait, but there is considerable sport in
spearing them.</p>
<p>We pass up the stream with our eyes
directed at the tree tops, but now and
then at the ever-changing aspect of the
river, taking in all the beauties of
nature and the curious formation of the
steep sides of the bluff. The face of the
bluff represents excellently the different
geological layers of soil and stone, here
chalky, there slaty, and here gaudily
daubed with all the brilliant hues of a clay
formation. The cottonwood and the willows
are just beginning to show green.
Now and then we come upon a nest in
the cottonwood trees, far out over the
water. Sometimes it is an old one, but
often we are convinced otherwise by the
sudden departure of a screaming hawk as
we throw a dead limb in that direction.
Then comes the hard climb, the toilsome
shin to reach the first limb, with knees
and elbows hugging tightly the smooth,
slippery bark, taking advantage of every
little knot and twig, and then, the limb
gained, up from limb to branch, up into
the air, into the cooling breeze, feeling
for the instant the life of the birds, up
into the swaying lesser branches, up to
the tip-top, where the big, rough nest of
sticks is firmly placed, the nether end of
a jackrabbit carcass half hanging over the
edge, and numerous ears, paws and small
bones along the rim, and inside four
handsome, large, speckled brown eggs of
the squirrel hawk. Into our little sack
they go, regardless of the remonstrances
of the angry hawk, which is circling
around overhead, and with the sack firmly
held in our teeth we descend to the
ground, pack the eggs into our case and
go on. Sometimes in the distance huge
clumps of mistletoe on the river oaks look
like nests, but nearer approach shows the
difference. Mistletoe is very plentiful
here. What a place for a party of girls
and boys to spend Christmas. Now we
come upon a bend in the river where the
ground is all strewed with driftwood left
by some winter freshet. There is enough
to keep many families in fuel for a long
time, but it lies there untouched, inaccessible,
to be carried on at the next flood&mdash;on
to where? Who knows the ending
of the travels of a piece of driftwood
that starts from the mills far up in the
Sierras? The wood is washed smooth
and round and into every conceivable
shape. At places we pass through thickets
of rose bushes, blackberry vines, and
elderberry, which grow profusely all
along the river. In a many-limbed willow
tree, an easy climb and not a high
one, we find the nest of a horned owl,
with five round white eggs within. The
old bird stayed on the nest until we were
nearly to it and then, with a peculiar cry,
scrambled over the side and fell to the
ground as if shot, then arose to a neighboring
branch and sat there, uttering a
cry like a cat and swelling out her feathers
angrily, but all in vain. Further up
the river ran in close to the bluff on our
side, and as the traveling was rather difficult
along land that lay at an angle of
only five or ten degrees from the vertical,
we scrambled to the top, at times slipping,
and often pulling ourselves up by the
weeds, so steep it was. A misstep would
have sent us rolling into the river below.
In the face of the bluff squirrels had their
homes, and we found the dwellings therein
of two handsome big snowy owls, but
they had wisely chosen them in places
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
where the five degrees of slope was in
under us and a crumbling of the sand
meant a straight drop of fifty or sixty
feet, so we left them with &ldquo;requiescat in
pace.&rdquo; For a quarter of a mile we followed
along the top of the bluff, watching
the river and the tree tops below us.
Flocks of ducks were flying up and down
the river, quacking vigorously. Now and
then a big, ugly &ldquo;shack&rdquo; rose from a
stump and flapped across the river. Isles
big and little and middlesized were dotted
in the stream, all heavily covered with
underbrush, an excellent refuge for the
ducks in their nesting season a little later
on. A big white pelican sat on a log
watching its victims in the water. The
river curves and bends and doubles on
itself, and never goes straight for forty
yards at a time. At a bend we came upon
a scene that delighted our ornithological
eyes. One hundred feet below us, in the
tops of a clump of cottonwoods, was a
heronry. Dozens of big, basket-like nests
blackened the tree tops, and perched on
the very topmost branches were dozens
of long-legged, crooked-necked, great
blue herons. As we came upon them they
started up, flapping their wings, stretching
out their necks and pulling in their
legs behind them. Uttering cries like
those of the seagulls, they flapped off and
lit away upon the plains, but within sight
of us, and seemed to be holding a consultation.
We could see into the most
of the nests, and they were all empty. It
was a little too early for the birds to begin
nesting, and they were evidently mating
and perhaps deciding who should
have first choice. Some nests looked like
old family residences of many generations,
for they had several stories and
additions, porticos and dormer windows,
so to speak, in abundance.</p>
<p>We passed on, and when the valley
widened out again we descended and sat
down under the oaks to eat our luncheon.
It soon disappeared, the last morsel, and
we were on our way again. At long intervals
farm houses appeared on the edge
of the bluff, and in the river below one
of them, on the opposite side of the
stream from us, was a curious old water-wheel
on a flatboat securely moored to
the trees on the bank, and which laboriously
and noisily jerked water up
through a pipe to the bluff above. The
meadows along the river are the pasturage
of big herds of horses and cattle, and
one is lucky if one&rsquo;s perambulations are
not interrupted by some inhospitable bull.
As we ascend the river it grows swifter
and more rocky and the top of the bluff
rolls higher and higher and the hills appear
in the distance. When we came to
the first of these low hills we climbed the
bluff and ascended it. It was a peculiar
formation of stone resembling sand in
softness or sand resembling stone in
hardness, we could hardly determine
which. It was seamed and ribbed, projecting
cliff-like into the air, with boulders
lying about and with caverns and
precipitous sides. As we scaled to the
top of it we scared away a number of
turkey buzzards that had been watching
our ascent, and it was evidently their
nesting place, as we discovered traces of
old nests and a good many bones of the
hapless denizens of the plains. We started
several of the big boulders at the edge
rolling and plunging down, and, though
most of them broke up in their downward
career, they stopped only when, after a
great plunge, they settled in the bed of
the river. Sometimes as they thundered
down they would startle a rabbit from
his repose, and off he would scamper in
great affright. But it was getting near
sundown and we were miles from our
wagon, and even when we reached that
we would be ten miles from home, so we
set out on our return with spirits not
lacking, but appetites sorely pressing. The
miles of climbing up hill and down hill
in the pure air had done us more good
than months in a gymnasium, and when,
long after dark, we reached our home in
Fresno town, what a supper we did eat.</p>

<p class="caption">BENGAL TIGER.
<br />(Felis tigris.)</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c27">THE BENGAL TIGER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Felis tigris.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Bengal Tiger (<i>Felis tigris</i>) inhabits
the hotter regions of Southern Asia,
but the species is found with certain color
variations throughout the lower levels of
all Asia from Siberia to the River Euphrates
and as far south as Sumatra and
Java. Next to the lion it is the strongest
and most ferocious of carnivorous animals,
and, on account of the heavily
wooded country in which it lives being
densely populated, the Tiger is even more
destructive of human life. In Bengal
alone three hundred and forty-seven persons
were reported killed by Tigers in a
single year, and this in spite of the best
efforts of the government and people to
mitigate the evil by poisoning, hunting
and trapping.</p>
<p>Mr. William T. Hornaday, who hunted
Tigers on his collecting trip in India,
says in his book, &ldquo;Two Years in the Jungle,&rdquo;
that only a limited number of
Tigers, and those of the old and decrepit
sort, ever kill men at all, but once they
have tasted human flesh they continue to
kill until some hunter reciprocates and
brings peace again to the ravaged district.
According to their habits in procuring
food the people of India divide Tigers
into three classes&mdash;the &ldquo;game killer,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;cattle lifter&rdquo; and the &ldquo;man killer.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;game killer&rdquo; lives in the dense forest,
catches his own deer and wild hogs and
is very self-respecting and honest, for a
Tiger. The &ldquo;cattle lifter&rdquo; is a fat and
lazy cat, who hangs around villages and
kills a steer from the herds whenever he
is hungry. Dragging away the carcass
he returns to it until it is all eaten, when
he kills again, while the timid and defenseless
natives flee in terror or hover
about, unable to protect their herds. It
is after these fat &ldquo;cattle lifters&rdquo; get old
and mangy that they turn &ldquo;man eater,&rdquo;
finding it easier to catch the herdsman
than to drag off a bullock. Then after
the first taste they haunt the paths and
villages, pouncing upon men, women
and children until there is no safety, except
within doors, until some hunter has
slain the foe.</p>
<p>Among the English of India Tiger
hunting is a favorite sport. A most picturesque
and safe way is to mount on an
Elephant and be driven about through the
country beating up the Tigers from cover
and shooting them with the huge four-bore
rifles which the English sportsmen
affect. The principal danger lies in the
stampeding of the elephant or the attack
of a wounded Tiger on the elephant himself.
The more common way is to build
a shooting platform by some water hole
or carcass and lie in wait for the Tiger,
or, better yet, have a small army of beaters
drive him from his lair and past the
spot where the platform has been erected.</p>
<p>Sometimes men who like to take
chances follow the Tigers on foot and
shoot them where they find them, which
is often coming straight through the air.
A glance at the illustration will show
what powerful forearms and shoulders
the tiger has. One blow from that paw
will break a bullock&rsquo;s back, and a wounded
Tiger is more dangerous than one
unhurt. Unless the brain is reached or
the spinal column broken a Tiger will
not stop in his charge, and the most
active man can hardly avoid his clutches.</p>
<p>An adult Bengal Tiger measures ten
feet from tip to tip, stands over three
and a half feet in height and weighs five
hundred pounds. If we consider the
strength, activity and ferocity of the ordinary
house cat and then think of it multiplied
a hundred times we can form
some conception of the Bengal Tiger as
he lies down by his water hole and wonders
what he will kill next.</p>
<p>In color the Tiger matches the foliage
of his native jungles. When lying in
grass or even upon the ground the dark
markings and rufous fawn colors of his
body blend almost perfectly with his
surroundings, and it has often happened
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
that his presence was only guessed by the
thrashing of his nervous tail in the grass
as he gathered for a leap. Grassy plains
and swamps are his favorite abiding
places, and he does not hesitate to swim
from island to island in search of prey.
Curiously, again, for a cat, the Tiger does
not climb trees except when forced to do
so by floods.</p>
<p>The Tigress gives birth to from two
to six cubs and is most affectionate toward
them and aggressive toward intruders
while she has them in charge.
As soon as they can eat she begins to
kill for them, and teaches them by a
thousand cruel tricks to imitate her example.
Not until they are nearly grown
and able to kill for themselves does she
separate herself and leave them to shift
for themselves. Young Tigers are far
more destructive than old, killing three
or four cattle and eating one, as if they
wished to learn their duties in life well
or were mad with the rage to kill.</p>
